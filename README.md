# Brews of Brewdog

This is a simple react project that uses beer data to get, filter and display information about various beers from Brewdog.

Currently, it uses static data from a data file stored in the project, but it will soon be refactored to use an API.

## Special features
- An age checker to verify your age(>18) before letting you inside the website. 
- Using routing to render different components, making the project a single-page application.
- Using states to keep track of the filtering options.
- Cute data bubble to make the page visually appealing.
- A side filter that slides in and out of view with the press of a button.
- A responsive website that adapts to different screen sizes.
